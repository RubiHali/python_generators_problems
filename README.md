# Python Generators: Hands-On Problems

A collection of simple yet powerful practical problems to grasp the understanding of Python generators and their lazy loading capabilties.

## Problems

### Problem 1 : Lazy Log File Processing
**Scenario**
Process a log file of upto **10GB** efficiently without loading it all into memory. Process upto **100** error lines where error lines contain the keyword **ERROR**

**Goal**
Use generators to read the file lazily and filter error lines dynamically

### Problem 2 : Real Time Analytics With Generators
**Scenario**
Build a Real Time analytics System which filters out any event other than **Purchase** and collects upto **50** purchase events

**Goal**
Use generators to simulate infinite stream of events on the fly.
